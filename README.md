# machine-learning notebooks

These notebooks are based heavily on the book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems* by Aurélien Géron.

They reproduce many of the book's examples and exercises using the same datasets. The goal is to show how to apply common machine learning techniques in Python with libraries like Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow.

Feel free to adapt these notebooks for your own experiments or to use them as a starting point for exploring other datasets.
